### The Data

* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) which have been used to extract the details on the genres, ratings and revenue in the market which we will use for correlation purposes.

### Results
Based on our analysis,  Action, Adventure, Sci-Fi has the highest revenue in the domestic market .A film with (Adventure,Animation,Comedy does well in the foreign market since it had the highest revenue. Adventure is the highly rated genre, meaning it is the most liked in both domestic and foreign market. Rating has close to no effect on revenue(both domestic and foreign) since there was a weak correlation between them. Measuring success in terms of revenue, runtime has close to no effect on movie success since the correlation between them was weak.

The project explored the datasets' structure and format through the examination of its initial rows. Rigorous checks for missing values and evaluations of data types were executed to guarantee consistency.

5. Cleaning the Data:
The project executed a systematic cleaning process to refine the datasets' quality. Addressing missing values, eliminating duplicates, and confirming data types were part of the initiative. The dataset was transformed into a polished state, ensuring data integrity and reliability for downstream analyses.

### Exploratory Data Analysis :
In-depth exploration of the dataset was conducted using statistical measures, visualizations and techniques. The project identified patterns, correlations, and trends within the movie data. The analysis focused on genres, sales, and ratings, providing actionable insights for strategic decision-making.
