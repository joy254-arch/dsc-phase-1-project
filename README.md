## DATA ANALYSIS OF THE MOVIE INDUSTRY FOR MICROSOFT 


### Business Problem

Microsoft wants to join the film industry in making movies, they want to create their own movie studio but first they need insight on how the film market is to enable them to make the neccessary decisions on their genres of choice. we are expected to gather enough data to make it easier for microsoft to make a top tier film studio. 


## Project Overview

This project enables Microsoft to have a glimpse of the film industry market and we are using data from imdb, the movie ratings on movie box also play a major role in the visualization of the data obtained from a range of genres that are individually rated, this helps Microsoft know which genre to choose to produce in order to be successful in the industry the use of charts extracted from our findings makes it easier for them to compare the differences in the genres making them fulfil the needs of their audience. 

### The Data

In the folder `imdb data' we have datasets from:
* [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) which have been used to extract the details on the genres, ratings and revenue in the market which we will use for correlation purposes. 

### Methods
This project uses descriptive analysis and a lot of visualizations such as bar graphs, histograms and heatmaps.These give an overview of the popular movie genres and what genres fetch the highest revenue.

### Results
Based on our analysis, Sci-Fi has the highest revenue in the domestic market .A film with (Adventure, Drama, Sport) does well in the foreign market since it had the highest revenue. Adventure is the highly rated genre, meaning it is the most liked in both domestic and foreign market. Rating has close to no effect on revenue(both domestic and foreign) since there was a weak correlation between them. Measuring success in terms of revenue, runtime has close to no effect on movie success since the correlation between them was weak.

### Conclusion
The analysis resulted in the following recommendation:
**For the domestic audience :** Focus more on producing Sci-Fi since that is what yields the highest revenue in the domestic market.
**For the foreign audience :** Focus more on producing a film with the genre combination of Adventure, Drama and Sport since that is what yields the highest revenue in the foreign market.
**Based on what is most liked by the two markets:** Focus on producing more Adventure themed films.
**Runtime has little impact on success in terms of revenue:** You are therefore have the flexibility of choosing the length of your filmns. You can focus on compelling story regardless of runtime
